You can specify which one you'd like to download and the filename you prefer.

**User**: The 3rd one looks good, please download and save it as ai_interaction.png

**Claude**: I'll download the 3rd image and save it as ai_interaction.png.

*[Claude calls the MCP tool to download the image]*

The image has been successfully downloaded and saved as ai_interaction.png! The file is saved in the icons directory of the project:

You can now use this image in your blog. Is there anything else you'd like me to help with?
